Shanocast is a Google Chromecast receiver which works with the Google Chrome browser. Demo:

# Usage

Shanocast runs on Linux and is reproducible via a Nix Flake

Get Nix and enable flakes, for example via the DetSys Nix installer

```
curl -L https://hydra.nixos.org/job/nix/master/buildStatic.x86_64-linux/latest/download-by-type/file/binary-dist > nix
chmod +x ./nix
```

```bash
 ./nix  --extra-experimental-features nix-command  run .#shanocast lo
```

the final argument `lo` specifies the network interface where the cast_receiver runs.

Finally, start Google Chrome and Shanocast should be listed as available for casting.

# Building

Build [Openscreen](https://chromium.googlesource.com/openscreen/) (commit 2a4dbe65) with this [patch](shanocast.patch)

# How it works

Shanocast is based on [Openscreen](https://chromium.googlesource.com/openscreen/) which is an open-source implementation of the Google Cast protocol.
The device authentication is performed with precomputed signatures taken from AirReceiver.
